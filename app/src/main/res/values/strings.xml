    <string name="passage_1"><b>CHAPTER I - TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH</b>\n\n
Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.
\n\n
For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.
\n\n
Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,—a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.
\n\n
As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, \'Let me see the child, and die.\'
\n\n
The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\'s head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:
\n\n
\'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.\'
\n\n
\'Lor bless her dear heart, no!\' interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
\n\n
\'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she\'ll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there\'s a dear young lamb do.\'
\n\n
Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\'s prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.
\n\n
The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back—and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.
\n\n
\'It\'s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\' said the surgeon at last.</string>
    <string name="passage_2"><b>CHAPTER II - TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD</b>\n\n
For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in \'the house\' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \'farmed,\' or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny\'s worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.
\n\n
Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for, the experimenal philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of HER system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.
\n\n
Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing—though the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurance in the farm—the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going. The children were neat and clean to behold, when THEY went; and what more would the people have!
\n\n
It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist\'s ninth birthday found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidely small in circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\'s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.
\n\n
\'Goodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\' said Mrs. Mann, thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy. \'(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \'em directly.)—My heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!\'
\n\n
Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\'s.
\n\n
\'Lor, only think,\' said Mrs. Mann, running out,—for the three boys had been removed by this time,—\'only think of that! That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\'
\n\n
Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the beadle.
\n\n
\'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\' inquired Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \'to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\'
\n\n
\'I\'m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\' replied Mrs. Mann with great humility.
\n\n
Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance. He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed.
\n\n
\'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,\' he replied in a calmer tone; \'it may be as you say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and have something to say.\'
\n\n
Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor; placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and can on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr. Bumble smiled.
\n\n
\'Now don\'t you be offended at what I\'m a going to say,\' observed Mrs. Mann, with captivating sweetness. \'You\'ve had a long walk, you know, or I wouldn\'t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr. Bumble?\'
\n\n
\'Not a drop. Nor a drop,\' said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a dignified, but placid manner.
\n\n
\'I think you will,\' said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. \'Just a leetle drop, with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\'
\n\n
Mr. Bumble coughed.
\n\n
\'Now, just a leetle drop,\' said Mrs. Mann persuasively.
\n\n
\'What is it?\' inquired the beadle.</string>
    <string name="passage_3"><b>CHAPTER III - RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE</b>\n\n
For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board. It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage individual\'s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to the other. To the performance of this feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still greater obstacle in Oliver\'s youth and childishness. He only cried bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble, and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him.
\n\n
Let it not be supposed by the enemies of \'the system,\' that, during the period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example. And so for from being denied the advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.
\n\n
It chanced one morning, while Oliver\'s affairs were in this auspicious and confortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather pressing. Mr. Gamfield\'s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a species of arthimetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered the bill on the gate.
\n\n
\'Wo—o!\' said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
\n\n
The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably, whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.
\n\n
Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey\'s. Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun him till he came back again. Having completed these arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.
\n\n
The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. So, he spelt the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
\n\n
\'This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \'prentis,\' said Mr. Gamfield.
\n\n
\'Ay, my man,\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a condescending smile. \'What of him?\'
\n\n
\'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good \'spectable chimbley-sweepin\' bisness,\' said Mr. Gamfield, \'I wants a \'prentis, and I am ready to take him.\'
\n\n
\'Walk in,\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had first seen him.
\n\n
\'It\'s a nasty trade,\' said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated his wish.
\n\n
\'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\' said another gentleman.
\n\n
\'That\'s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make \'em come down again,\' said Gamfield; \'that\'s all smoke, and no blaze; vereas smoke ain\'t o\' no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\'s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\'l\'men, and there\'s nothink like a good hot blaze to make \'em come down vith a run. It\'s humane too, gen\'l\'men, acause, even if they\'ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes \'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\'
\n\n
The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr. Limbkins. The board then procedded to converse among themselves for a few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \'saving of expenditure,\' \'looked well in the accounts,\' \'have a printed report published,\' were alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.
\n\n
At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:
\n\n
\'We have considered your proposition, and we don\'t approve of it.\'
\n\n
\'Not at all,\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
\n\n
\'Decidedly not,\' added the other members.
\n\n
As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table.
\n\n
\'So you won\'t let me have him, gen\'l\'men?\' said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near the door.
\n\n
\'No,\' replied Mr. Limbkins; \'at least, as it\'s a nasty business, we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\'
\n\n
Mr. Gamfield\'s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned to the table, and said,
\n\n
\'What\'ll you give, gen\'l\'men? Come! Don\'t be too hard on a poor man. What\'ll you give?\'
\n\n
\'I should say, three pound ten was plenty,\' said Mr. Limbkins.
\n\n
\'Ten shillings too much,\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
\n\n
\'Come!\' said Gamfield; \'say four pound, gen\'l\'men. Say four pound, and you\'ve got rid of him for good and all. There!\'
\n\n
\'Three pound ten,\' repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.
\n\n
\'Come! I\'ll split the diff\'erence, gen\'l\'men, urged Gamfield. \'Three pound fifteen.\'
\n\n
\'Not a farthing more,\' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.

\'You\'re desperate hard upon me, gen\'l\'men, said Gamfield, wavering.</string>
